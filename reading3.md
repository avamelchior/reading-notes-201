## Reading Notes 3

### Learn HTML

**When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?**

When you want to make a list that is in no particular order.

**How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?**

You can use list-style-type in CSS.

**When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?**

Use an ordered list for numbers, and an unordered list for bullet points.

**Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?**

You can use list-style-type in CSS.

My sources for these questions were ChatGPT and from the Learn HTML tab.

### Learn CSS

**Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?**

Margin's role would be keeping everything in the kingdom together and padding would be the punching bag that protects the kingdom from harm.

**List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.**

Content: The innermost part of an HTML element's box, where the actual content, such as text or images, is displayed.

Padding: The space between the content and the element's border, providing internal spacing and cushioning for the content.

Border: The line or boundary that surrounds the padding and content, separating the element from its neighboring elements.

Margin: The space outside the border, creating separation between the element and other elements on the webpage. It controls the element's spacing in relation to its surroundings.

### Learn JS

**What data types can you store inside of an Array?**

You can store various data types inside a JavaScript Array, including numbers, strings, booleans, objects, functions, null, undefined, symbols, and other arrays.

**Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?**

Whether the "people" array is valid depends on its declaration and population. If declared like const people = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"];, it's valid.

**List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.**

+=: Adds the right operand to the left operand.

-=: Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.

*=: Multiplies the left operand by the right operand.

/=: Divides the left operand by the right operand.

%=: Computes the remainder of division and assigns it.

**Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.**

The answer would be 10dog.

**Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.**

In a weather application, you can use a conditional statement to check the current temperature. If the temperature is below a certain threshold, you display a message like "Bring a jacket".

**Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.**

Loop: In an online shopping cart, a loop can be used to iterate through the items in the cart and calculate the total cost.
